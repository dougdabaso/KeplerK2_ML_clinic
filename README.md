# KeplerK2_ML_clinic
Repository with Machine Learning (ML) and statistical tools + tutorials on analyzing and processing Kepler/K2 data# Kepler-data-analysis

In this repository I will include some of the Python scripts and Jupyter nootbook files I prepared, presenting Machine Learning (ML) and statistical techniques to remove noise and artifacts, improve readability and support the choice of parameters required to process and analyze datasest from the Kepler/K2 missions, specially lightcurves.  

* Available tutorials as Jupyter notebook files:
lightcurve_trend_filtering_EMD.ipynb - Filtering trends in lightcurves with EMD (a parameter-free alternative to Savitzky-Golay filtering)

* Available modules

- lightcurve_analysis

  -ML_and_stat_tools class
  
  Class to compute some ML and statistical tools to analyze Kepler/K2 data, specially lightcurve time series.
    
New function and classes: to be updated
